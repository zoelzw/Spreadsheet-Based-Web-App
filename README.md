# Spreadsheet-Based-Web-App

## Vision: A searchable web app for adaptive products 
- accessible (more details needed)
  - convenient searches and listig: 
    - filtering: e.g. by price (selecting range); by region (drop down menu); by function (check box)...
    - listing: e.g. sidebar 
  - navigation bars 
- implementation and maintainess 
  - free 
- feedback/comments/new records
  - easy to update from the front end 
  - secure 


## Approaches 
0. static sites that contains pre-made tables/lists...
  - could add comment functions by Staticman
  - subscribable using atom
  - could build a web crawler to keep generating and adding the latest products around the world 

  
1. searchable html tables 
  - Jekyll + jQuery 
  - Flask (later)
  
2. Google sheets as database 
  - Google Sites 
  - Google Sheet Web App 
  
3. PSQL database with front end implementations to directly manipulate the database
